## Problem Analysis

### Initial Problem Statement

Traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle have several limitations:

1. **Static Content Delivery**: Course content is typically presented in a linear, one-size-fits-all format
2. **Limited Search Capabilities**: Standard search functions rely on exact keyword matching
3. **Rigid Assessment Methods**: Quizzes and assessments are manually created and don't adapt to learner needs
4. **No Conversational Interface**: Users can't ask natural language questions about content
5. **Minimal Personalization**: Limited ability to tailor learning paths to individual needs

### Opportunity Analysis

We identified several opportunities to enhance the learning experience:

1. **AI-Powered Assistance**: Using LLMs to provide contextual answers to learner questions
2. **Semantic Search**: Implementing vector-based search for better content discovery
3. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Automatically creating quizzes and interactive content
4. **Personalized Learning**: Adapting content recommendations based on learner behavior
5. **Multimedia Processing**: Extracting value from video content through transcription

### User Personas

We designed the system with two primary user personas in mind:

1. **Learner (Staff Member)**
   - **Needs**: Quick answers to questions, efficient learning paths, engaging content
   - **Pain Points**: Information overload, difficulty finding relevant content, lack of guidance
   - **Goals**: Master product knowledge, improve job performance, efficient use of learning time

2. **Administrator (L&D Professional)**
   - **Needs**: User engagement insights, content effectiveness metrics, system management
   - **Pain Points**: Content creation workload, measuring learning outcomes, manual tasks
   - **Goals**: Optimize training programs, reduce content development time, improve ROI on training

## Core Design Decisions

### Dual-Framework Approach

**Decision**: Combine Flask and FastAPI in the same application

**Rationale**:
- Flask provides mature template rendering and session management for web interfaces
- FastAPI offers superior performance for API endpoints and automatic documentation
- This hybrid approach leverages strengths of both frameworks without complete refactoring

**Trade-offs**:
- Increased complexity in routing and application structure
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with one framework
- Potential duplication of some functionality

### Modular Service Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a service-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Rationale**:
- Isolates business logic from presentation and data layers
- Enables independent testing and development of components
- Facilitates future scaling of specific services
- Makes code more maintainable and understandable

**Implementation**:
- Services directory containing focused service modules
- Dependency injection pattern in FastAPI
- Blueprint/router pattern to organize routes

### Dual Interface Approach

**Decision**: Create two distinct user interfaces (Learner and Admin)

**Rationale**:
- Different user personas have fundamentally different needs
- Learner interface focuses on content consumption and assistance
- Admin interface prioritizes data analysis and system management
- Specialized interfaces reduce cognitive load and improve UX

**Implementation**:
- Shared base template with consistent styling
- Role-based access control to appropriate interfaces
- Component-based design for maintainability

## Technology Selection Rationale

4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining Flask for UI and FastAPI for API

**Decision Factors**:
- Need for both traditional web views and high-performance APIs
- Desire for automatic API documentation
- Team familiarity with Flask
- Requirement for both synchronous and asynchronous operations

**Final Decision**: Hybrid approach with Flask and FastAPI, leveraging strengths of both

### Database Technology Selection

**Options Considered**:
1. **PostgreSQL**: Robust, mature, supports relational and document data

4. **Neo4j**: Graph database, good for relational learning paths

**Decision Factors**:
- Need for transaction support and data integrity
- Requirement for complex queries with joins
- Hybrid data storage needs (relational + vector)
- Deployment complexity considerations

**Final Decision**: PostgreSQL for relational data + Pinecone for vector embeddings

### AI Model Selection

**Options Considered**:
1. **OpenAI Models**: High performance, easy API, expensive
2. **Hugging Face Models**: Open-source options, self-hostable, more control
3. **Custom Fine-tuned Model**: Tailored to educational domain, resource-intensive
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Different models for different tasks

**Decision Factors**:
- Cost considerations for production usage
- Response quality requirements
